Description: Computes predictions over a range of values found in the data, for
    almost all models in the R ecosystem. The predictions are called the
    average marginal effects or partial dependencies, depending on the
    statistical community. The values of predictors are sampled across the
    quantiles of a variable, which has the side benefit of revealing where data
    is sparse or dense.  Confidence intervals are estimated using
    bootstrapping.
