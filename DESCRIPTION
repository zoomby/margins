Description: Computes predictions over a range of values, for almost all models
    in the R ecosystem. These are called the average marginal effects or
    partial dependencies, depending on the statistical community. The
    particular values of a variable used for predictions are sampled across its
    quantiles.  Confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrapping.
Depends:
    R (>= 2.8.0),
    data.table (>= 0.5),
    multicore (>= 0.1),
    ggplot2 (>= 0.9),
